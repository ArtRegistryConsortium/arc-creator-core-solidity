import { const base: string
The base path of the deployment. Typically this is equivalent to config.kit.paths.base, but it is calculated from location.pathname meaning that it will continue to work correctly if the site is deployed to a subdirectory.
Note that there is a base but no assets, since service workers cannot be used if config.kit.paths.assets is specified.


base, const build: string[]
An array of URL strings representing the files generated by Vite, suitable for caching with cache.addAll(build).
During development, this is an empty array.


build, const files: string[]
An array of URL strings representing the files in your static directory, or whatever directory is specified by config.kit.files.assets. You can customize which files are included from static directory using config.kit.serviceWorker.files


files, const prerendered: string[]
An array of pathnames corresponding to prerendered pages and endpoints.
During development, this is an empty array.


prerendered, const version: string
See config.kit.version. It’s useful for generating unique cache names inside your service worker, so that a later deployment of your app can invalidate old caches.


version } from '$service-worker';
```

This module is only available to service workers.
## base
The `base` path of the deployment. Typically this is equivalent to `config.kit.paths.base`, but it is calculated from `location.pathname` meaning that it will continue to work correctly if the site is deployed to a subdirectory. Note that there is a `base` but no `assets`, since service workers cannot be used if `config.kit.paths.assets` is specified.
```
const base: string;
```

## build
An array of URL strings representing the files generated by Vite, suitable for caching with `cache.addAll(build)`. During development, this is an empty array.
```
const build: string[];
```

## files
An array of URL strings representing the files in your static directory, or whatever directory is specified by `config.kit.files.assets`. You can customize which files are included from `static` directory using `config.kit.serviceWorker.files`
```
const files: string[];
```

## prerendered
An array of pathnames corresponding to prerendered pages and endpoints. During development, this is an empty array.
```
const prerendered: string[];
```

## version
See `config.kit.version`. It’s useful for generating unique cache names inside your service worker, so that a later deployment of your app can invalidate old caches.
