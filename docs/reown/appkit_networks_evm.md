# EVM Compatible Chains
## Support for all EVM Chains​
The AppKit SDK supports all EVM-compatible chains, allowing users to connect their EVM wallets to Web3 applications. As long as the EVM chain you are trying to configure is included in Viem's package, AppKit will support it.
**AppKit provides a simple, secure, and seamless in-app experience for users looking to transact within web3.**
