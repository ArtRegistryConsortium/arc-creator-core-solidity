To use SvelteKit as a static site generator (SSG), use `adapter-static`.
This will prerender your entire site as a collection of static files. If you’d like to prerender only some pages and dynamically server-render others, you will need to use a different adapter together with the `prerender` option.
## Usage
Install with `npm i -D @sveltejs/adapter-static`, then add the adapter to your `svelte.config.js`:
svelte.config
```
import import adapteradapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-static';
export default {
	```
kit: {
  adapter: any;
}
```
`kit: { `adapter: any`adapter: `import adapter`adapter({ // default options are shown. On some platforms // these options are set automatically — see below `pages: string`pages: 'build', `assets: string`assets: 'build', `fallback: undefined`fallback: `var undefined`undefined, `precompress: boolean`precompress: false, `strict: boolean`strict: true }) } };`
```

...and add the `prerender` option to your root layout:
src/routes/+layout
```
// This can be false if you're using a fallback (i.e. SPA mode)
export const const prerender: trueprerender = true;
```

> You must ensure SvelteKit’s `trailingSlash` option is set appropriately for your environment. If your host does not render `/a.html` upon receiving a request for `/a` then you will need to set `trailingSlash: 'always'` in your root layout to create `/a/index.html` instead.
## Zero-config support
Some platforms have zero-config support (more to come in future):
  * Vercel


On these platforms, you should omit the adapter options so that `adapter-static` can provide the optimal configuration:
svelte.config
```
export default {
	```
kit: {
  adapter: any;
}
```
`kit: { `adapter: any`adapter: adapter({...}) } };`
```

## Options
### pages
The directory to write prerendered pages to. It defaults to `build`.
### assets
The directory to write static assets (the contents of `static`, plus client-side JS and CSS generated by SvelteKit) to. Ordinarily this should be the same as `pages`, and it will default to whatever the value of `pages` is, but in rare circumstances you might need to output pages and assets to separate locations.
### fallback
Specify a fallback page for SPA mode, e.g. `index.html` or `200.html` or `404.html`.
### precompress
If `true`, precompresses files with brotli and gzip. This will generate `.br` and `.gz` files.
### strict
By default, `adapter-static` checks that either all pages and endpoints (if any) of your app were prerendered, or you have the `fallback` option set. This check exists to prevent you from accidentally publishing an app where some parts of it are not accessible, because they are not contained in the final output. If you know this is ok (for example when a certain page only exists conditionally), you can set `strict` to `false` to turn off this check.
## GitHub Pages
When building for GitHub Pages, if your repo name is not equivalent to `your-username.github.io`, make sure to update `config.kit.paths.base` to match your repo name. This is because the site will be served from `https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name` rather than from the root.
You’ll also want to generate a fallback `404.html` page to replace the default 404 page shown by GitHub Pages.
A config for GitHub Pages might look like the following:
svelte.config
```
import import adapteradapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-static';
/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */
const ```
const config: {
  kit: {
    adapter: any;
    paths: {
 base: string | undefined;
    };
  };
}
```
`
@type{import('@sveltejs/kit').Config}
config = { ````
kit: {
  adapter: any;
  paths: {
    base: string | undefined;
  };
}
```
`kit: { `adapter: any`adapter: `import adapter`adapter({ `fallback: string`fallback: '404.html' }), ````
paths: {
  base: string | undefined;
}
```
`paths: { `base: string | undefined`base: `var process: NodeJS.Process`process.`NodeJS.Process.argv: string[]`
The `process.argv` property returns an array containing the command-line arguments passed when the Node.js process was launched. The first element will be  {@link  execPath } . See `process.argv0` if access to the original value of `argv[0]` is needed. The second element will be the path to the JavaScript file being executed. The remaining elements will be any additional command-line arguments.
For example, assuming the following script for `process-args.js`:
```
import { argv } from 'node:process';
// print process.argv
argv.forEach((val, index) => {
 console.log(`${index}: ${val}`);
});
```

Launching the Node.js process as:
```
node process-args.js one two=three four
```

Would generate the output:
```
0: /usr/local/bin/node
1: /Users/mjr/work/node/process-args.js
2: one
3: two=three
4: four
```

@sincev0.1.27
argv.`Array<string>.includes(searchElement: string, fromIndex?: number): boolean`
Determines whether an array includes a certain element, returning true or false as appropriate.
@paramsearchElement The element to search for.
@paramfromIndex The position in this array at which to begin searching for searchElement.
includes('dev') ? '' : `var process: NodeJS.Process`process.`NodeJS.Process.env: NodeJS.ProcessEnv`
The `process.env` property returns an object containing the user environment. See `environ(7)`.
An example of this object looks like:
```
{
 TERM: 'xterm-256color',
 SHELL: '/usr/local/bin/bash',
 USER: 'maciej',
 PATH: '~/.bin/:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin',
 PWD: '/Users/maciej',
 EDITOR: 'vim',
 SHLVL: '1',
 HOME: '/Users/maciej',
 LOGNAME: 'maciej',
 _: '/usr/local/bin/node'
}
```

It is possible to modify this object, but such modifications will not be reflected outside the Node.js process, or (unless explicitly requested) to other `Worker` threads. In other words, the following example would not work:
```
node -e 'process.env.foo = "bar"' &#x26;#x26;&#x26;#x26; echo $foo
```

While the following will:
```
import { env } from 'node:process';
env.foo = 'bar';
console.log(env.foo);
```

Assigning a property on `process.env` will implicitly convert the value to a string. **This behavior is deprecated.** Future versions of Node.js may throw an error when the value is not a string, number, or boolean.
```
import { env } from 'node:process';
env.test = null;
console.log(env.test);
// => 'null'
env.test = undefined;
console.log(env.test);
// => 'undefined'
```

Use `delete` to delete a property from `process.env`.
```
import { env } from 'node:process';
env.TEST = 1;
delete env.TEST;
console.log(env.TEST);
// => undefined
```

On Windows operating systems, environment variables are case-insensitive.
```
import { env } from 'node:process';
env.TEST = 1;
console.log(env.test);
// => 1
```

Unless explicitly specified when creating a `Worker` instance, each `Worker` thread has its own copy of `process.env`, based on its parent thread’s `process.env`, or whatever was specified as the `env` option to the `Worker` constructor. Changes to `process.env` will not be visible across `Worker` threads, and only the main thread can make changes that are visible to the operating system or to native add-ons. On Windows, a copy of `process.env` on a `Worker` instance operates in a case-sensitive manner unlike the main thread.
@sincev0.1.27
env.`string | undefined`BASE_PATH } } }; export default ````
const config: {
  kit: {
    adapter: any;
    paths: {
 base: string | undefined;
    };
  };
}
```
`
@type{import('@sveltejs/kit').Config}
config;`
```

You can use GitHub actions to automatically deploy your site to GitHub Pages when you make a change. Here’s an example workflow:
.github/workflows/deploy
```
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
on:
 push:
  branches: 'main'
jobs:
 build_site:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
   - name: Checkout
    uses: actions/checkout@v4
   # If you're using pnpm, add this step then change the commands and cache key below to use `pnpm`
   # - name: Install pnpm
   #  uses: pnpm/action-setup@v3
   #  with:
   #   version: 8
   - name: Install Node.js
    uses: actions/setup-node@v4
    with:
 node-version: 20
 cache: npm
   - name: Install dependencies
    run: npm install
   - name: build
    env:
 BASE_PATH: '/${{ github.event.repository.name }}'
    run: |
 npm run build
   - name: Upload Artifacts
    uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
    with:
 # this should match the `pages` option in your adapter-static options
 path: 'build/'
 deploy:
  needs: build_site
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  permissions:
   pages: write
   id-token: write
  environment:
   name: github-pages
   url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
  steps:
   - name: Deploy
    id: deployment
    uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

If you’re not using GitHub actions to deploy your site (for example, you’re pushing the built site to its own repo), add an empty `.nojekyll` file in your `static` directory to prevent Jekyll from interfering.
